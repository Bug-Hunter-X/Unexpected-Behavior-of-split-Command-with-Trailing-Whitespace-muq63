This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Tcl related to the `split` command and trailing whitespace in strings. The `bug.tcl` file shows the erroneous behavior, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides a corrected version. The issue arises because `split` includes empty strings in the result when multiple separators are consecutive or are present at the end of the string. The solution involves trimming trailing whitespace before splitting the string.
